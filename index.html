                <p> I am an undergrad, majoring in Computer Science- Machine Learning. 
                    As a child, my exposure to Computer Science was very little. But, 
                    as I enrolled in engineering classes in my second year of college, 
                    my interest in Computer Science was aroused. When I first started 
                    college, I was interested in Biomedical engineering, but soon it 
                    changed to Dentistry. After not gaining any satisfaction from 
                    dentistry, I changed my focus to Computer Science and started 
                    pursuing my bachelor's degree in the field. My strengths lie in 
                    problem-solving, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning.
                    My interest mainly lies in AI programming, software development, 
                    and game programming. I aspire to work in the field of Artificial 
                    Intelligence while pursuing photography as a hobby.

                    Here is a little more about me<a href="https://pradhanshreya2001.wixsite.com/shreya398r/home" > here</a> </p>

                    <h2>Groupme Bot</h2>
                    <p> Created a bot in groupme chat that greets others 
                        when they say good morning/night. Then, it will only 
                        reply to me in case if any other message was sent. 
                        The bot also has the ability to play a simple 
                        rock-paper-scissors game with me!

                    <h2>Title Matching game</h2>
                    <p> Created a tile matching game using Java.</p>
                    <p> On the screen is a grid where and the colors appear randomly. 
                        The players have to click on the grid that has more than 2 tiles 
                        of same color that are adjacent to each other to clear the grid.
                        The game is over once the grids are completely filled with color.

                    <h2>Cafe Inventory</h2>
                    <p> Created a store inventory in Java. Since it is 
                        an inventory, you can add, list, and delete new food items.
                        If you want to know how many items remaining, use the list 
                        function to get the amount of specified items left. Then, when 
                        a consumer arrives, depending of what and how much they bought, 
                        adjust the number of items and then calculate the total amount 
                        earned. Each item has a name and cost.
